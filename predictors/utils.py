    Returns a guess of good values for num_clusters and n_clustering based solely
    on the number of classes and the number of examples per class.

    This relies on two heuristics:
    1) We want at least 150 points per cluster on average
    2) We need more samples as we try to distinguish between more distributions.
    To distinguish between 2 distribution, want at least 4 samples per class.
    To distinguish between 5 distributions, want at least 10 samples per class.
